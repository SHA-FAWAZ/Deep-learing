Deep learning Introduction:
Deep Learing is defines about to working on complex neural networks.This topic is subset of the machine learing.
Type of layers in Deep learing:
1.Input Layer:
recive the raw data to the machine


2.hiddin Layer:
perform the computions in the hidden layer which is proccess the data 

3.output layer:
prodie the final output and prediciton on classification 

Acitvation fuctions iin deep learning

1.relu :rectified liner unit:
Which is used to the hidden layer to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simple used to speed up during the training of the data
2.sigmoid:
map the values binary  (0 and 1 in the layer).
3.softmax:
conver the raw data (score) conver into the probabity on the givendata

Back propogration and optimisation :

In this propogration setp we use some of the example -mes(mean standerd error,),cross entropy stop: which are optimises the data
